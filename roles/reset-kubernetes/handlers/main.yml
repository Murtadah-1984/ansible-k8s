# RESET KUBERNETES ROLE - HANDLERS
# =============================================================================
# NOTE: This role does not use handlers because:
#   - It performs a full cluster reset, not configuration changes
#   - Services are directly managed (stopped/started) in tasks
#   - Handlers are typically used for restarting services after config changes
# =============================================================================
# This file is kept for consistency with other roles, but handlers are not used
# in the reset-kubernetes role tasks.
